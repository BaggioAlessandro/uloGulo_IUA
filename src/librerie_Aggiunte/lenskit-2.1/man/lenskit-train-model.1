.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]lenskit train\-model\f[] \- train a LensKit model and serialize it
to disk.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]lenskit\f[] [GLOBAL OPTIONS] \f[B]train\-model\f[] [OPTIONS]
\f[I]CONFIG\f[]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]train\-model\f[] command loads a LensKit algorithm
configuration, instantiates its shareable components, and writes the
resulting recommender engine to a file.
This file can then be loaded into an application or one of the other
LensKit commands to provide recommendations and predictions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[I]CONFIG\f[]
A LensKit algorithm configuration file, written in the LensKit algorithm
DSL for Groovy.
If multiple configuration files are specified, they are used together,
with configuration in later files taking precedence over earlier files.

.B \-\-help

.TP
.B \-o \f[I]FILE\f[], \-\-output\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Write the resulting recommender model to \f[I]FILE\f[].
If this option is not specified, the model will be written to
\f[C]model.bin\f[] in the current directory.
If \f[I]FILE\f[] ends in \f[C]\&.gz\f[], the file will be
gzip\-compressed.
Compressed model files can be transparently read by LensKit, so this is
usually a good idea.

.SS Input Data Options
.PP
This command can read data in several different ways.
To give the model building process some data to work with, one of the
following mutually\-exclusive options must be present:
.TP
.B \-\-ratings\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the delimited text file \f[I]FILE\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-csv\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the CSV file \f[I]FILE\f[].
This is identical to passing \f[C]\-\-ratings\-file=FILE\f[] with
\f[C]\-\-delimiter=,\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-tsv\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the tab\-separated file \f[I]FILE\f[].
This is identical to passing \f[C]\-\-ratings\-file=FILE\f[] with
\f[C]\-\-delimiter=^I\f[], but doesn\[aq]t require you to know how to
encode tab characters in your shell.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-pack\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the packed rating file \f[I]FILE\f[].
Packed files can be created with the \f[B]pack\-ratings\f[] command.
.RS
.RE
.PP
Additionally, the following options provide additional control over the
data input:
.TP
.B \-d \f[I]DELIM\f[], \-\-delimiter \f[I]DELIM\f[]
Use \f[I]DELIM\f[] as the delimiter for delimited text files.
Only effective in conjunction with \f[C]\-\-ratings\-file\f[].
.RS
.RE
.SS Script Environment Options
.PP
This command takes the standard LensKit script environment options:
.TP
.B \-C \f[I]URL\f[], \-\-classpath \f[I]URL\f[]
Add \f[I]URL\f[] (which can be a path to a local directory or JAR file)
to the classpath for loading the configuration scripts.
This URL can contain additional components for the recommenders.
This option can be specified multiple times to add multiple locations to
the classpath.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-D \f[I]PROP\f[]=\f[I]VALUE\f[], \-\-define
\f[I]PROP\f[]=\f[I]VALUE\f[]
Define the property \f[I]PROP\f[] to equal \f[I]VALUE\f[].
This option is currently ignored for this command.
To set Java system properties, use the \f[C]JAVA_OPTS\f[] environment
variable (see \f[B]lenskit\f[](1)).
